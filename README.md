## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser with ES6 module support (Chrome 89+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 89+)
- Internet connection (for loading Three.js library from CDN)

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd 3DInteractive
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser

**Note**: Due to ES6 module imports, you may need to serve the files through a local server rather than opening the HTML file directly. Use one of these methods:

#### Option 1: Python
```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

#### Option 2: Node.js
```bash
npx http-server
```

#### Option 3: VS Code Live Server
Install the "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live" in the bottom right corner.

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Usage

### Designing Your Home

1. **Set Dimensions**: Enter values in the "House Width" and "House Depth" input fields
2. **Choose Stories**: Select 1, 2, or 3 stories from the dropdown
3. **Select Roof Style**: Choose between Gable, Hip, or Flat roof styles
4. **Choose Materials**: Select realistic wall and roof materials from the dropdowns
5. **Adjust Windows**: Use the slider to set the number of windows (4-16)
6. **Add Front Porch** (Optional): Select "Small" or "Large" porch with columns and roof
7. **Add Garage** (Optional): Select "Single" (12 ft) or "Double" (20 ft) from the garage type dropdown
8. **Click "Update Design"**: Apply your changes and see the 3D model update

### Navigation

- **Rotate**: Left-click and drag to orbit around the home

#### Design Data
Click **"Export Data"** to download a JSON file containing:
- All design parameters (dimensions, colors, roof style, etc.)
- Calculated values (square footage, volume, etc.)
- Timestamp of export

Example JSON output:
```json

- **ES6 Modules**: Modern JavaScript with import/export
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with CSS custom properties
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with Canvas API

## Technical Architecture

### ES6 Module Structure
```javascript
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { OrbitControls } from 'three/addons/controls/OrbitControls.js';

class HomeDesigner {
    init()              // Initialize Three.js scene
    buildHome()         // Construct complete 3D home
    buildStory()        // Create individual floor
    buildRoof()         // Generate roof geometry
    buildGarage()       // Add garage structure
    captureScreenshot() // Export PNG image
    exportData()        // Export JSON data
    animate()           // Render loop
}
```

### Key Features

#### Dynamic Model Generation
- Procedurally generates walls, windows, and doors based on dimensions
- Automatically calculates window placement based on house width
- Scales all elements proportionally

#### Roof Styles
- **Gable**: Traditional triangular roof using extruded shape geometry
- **Hip**: Four-sided pyramid roof with custom buffer geometry
- **Flat**: Simple box geometry with slight overhang

#### Garage System
- **Single**: 4-meter wide garage
- **Double**: 7-meter wide garage
- Attached to the right side of the house
- Includes garage door with realistic texture

#### Rendering Pipeline
1. Scene setup with fog and background color
2. Directional lighting with shadow mapping
3. Ambient lighting for overall illumination
4. Grid helper for spatial reference
5. Ground plane for shadow reception

## Color Scheme

Primary color: `#667eea` (Indigo/Purple)
- Used for primary buttons and accent elements
- Hover state: `#5568d3`

Background colors:
- Canvas: `#f5f7fa` (Light gray)
- Sidebar: `#ffffff` (White)
- Info panel: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95)` with backdrop blur

- No terrain or landscaping
- No custom material textures (colors only)

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- [ ] Interior room layout and furniture
- [ ] Custom window/door placement
- [ ] Texture mapping for realistic materials
- [ ] Multiple garage positions
- [ ] Deck/patio additions
- [ ] Landscaping elements (trees, grass, etc.)
- [ ] Save/load designs to browser storage
- [ ] Share designs via URL
- [ ] 3D model export (OBJ, GLTF, STL)
- [ ] Print-friendly 2D floor plans
- [ ] Cost estimation calculator
- [ ] Mobile touch controls optimization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: "Failed to resolve module specifier" error
- **Solution**: Make sure you're serving the files through a local server, not opening the HTML file directly (file:// protocol doesn't support ES6 modules)

**Problem**: Canvas is blank or black
- **Solution**: Check browser console for WebGL errors. Your browser/GPU must support WebGL 1.0+

**Problem**: Controls not working
- **Solution**: Try refreshing the page. Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser.

**Problem**: Screenshot button not working
- **Solution**: Some browsers block automatic downloads. Check your browser's download settings.
